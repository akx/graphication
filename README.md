Graphication
============

> In a quest to make new and better code for LastGraph, I decided to make it more
> generic and accessible for anyone to use, and so here we have Graphication.

> It uses Cairo for rendering, and is designed to be (somewhat) modular and
> expandable. Early releases only do wavegraphs, but hopefully this will improve
> as time goes on.
